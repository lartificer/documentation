# What is Lartificer?

Lartificer is a collection of composer packages aimed to help you get started with common functionality for Laravel websites.
 
 
All packages are built to be extremely easy to embed but do not take away the possibility to modify the behaviour. You want to create a basic business website with a news area and a contactform?

**Step 1: Execute**

    composer require lartificer/contactform
    composer require lartificer/news
    
**Step 2: Create links to /news and /contact in your template**

**Step 3: Nothing more to do, you are done.**

All Lartificer packages provide a completely functioning component which works out of the box. All components are translateable, provide views and migrations and will be working as soon as you pull them into your project.
