# Welcome to easy Laravel bootstrapping

Lartificer is a collection of composer packages aimed to help you get started with common functionality for Laravel websites.

All packages are built to be extremely easy to embed but do not take away the possibility to modify the behaviour.

All Lartificer packages provide a completely functioning component which works out of the box. All components are translateable, provide views and migrations and will be working as soon as you pull them into your project.
